# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive and educational web application to visualize how different sorting algorithms work step by step.
This tool provides a visual understanding of how sorting algorithms manipulate data through animations and color codes. Perfect for students, educators, or anyone curious about algorithm behavior.

## ✅ Implemented Algorithms
- 🔁 Bubble Sort  
- 🧩 Selection Sort  
- ✍️ Insertion Sort  
- 🔀 Merge Sort  
- ⚡ Quick Sort  
- 🧱 Heap Sort  

## 🎨 Visualization Guide
Each sorting step is highlighted using color-coded bars:
- 🔵 **Blue** – Default (unsorted)  
- 🟡 **Yellow** – Elements currently being compared  
- 🔴 **Red** – Incorrect position, needs to be moved  
- 🟢 **Green** – Correctly placed element  

## ⚙️ Controls
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed across 5 levels  
- **Data Size**: Modify the number of elements to sort  
- **Generate Array**: Create a new randomly shuffled array  

## 📊 Complexity Insights
During each sort, the application displays:
- **Time Complexity** (Best, Average, Worst)  
- **Space Complexity**

## 💡 Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript
